Each summer, kids ages 10-18 come to CU-Boulder’s campus to study Shakespeare with CSF professionals. Working in small groups, these students learn about Shakespeare by rehearsing, staging, and performing a shortened play on the Outdoor Mary Rippon Stage. Camp Shakespeare is a fabulous way for kids and teens to explore theater and Shakespeare in a creative and supportive environment.\nIn addition to acting training, students participate in master classes with special guests from the CSF company. Campers also work with a stage combat professional to learn the safe way to fight onstage. Tuition includes one ticket to attend a CSF production.\nCSF will offer two sessions of Camp Shakespeare in the summer of 2016. Campers may register for Session One (May 31-June 27), Session Two (July 18-August 5) or both.  \n\nEach session of Camp Shakespeare will culminate in free public performances on the Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre (Session One: Monday, June 27; Session Two: Friday, August 5)"

They will ride the same horse all week so as to build a trusting relationship. They will also ride in helmets, and on bareback pads to build balance and to feel the horse's movement beneath them. Campers will also have a daily guitar lesson with an accomplished instructor. They will each build a Native American themed dream catcher, paint, and create a horse-themed photo frame. Campers will also learn to handle, groom and care for several small animals: goats, chickens and sheep. Lastly, campers will also have the opportunity to spin a lariat, rope a robo-calf, and ride the giant rope swing! Hay rides, picnic lunches, and popsicles are daily highlights here at Horses & More Summer Camp. Knowledgeable, caring instructors comprised of teachers, education majors, agricultural majors, music majors, and equestrian experts, will provide a positive learning experience for your camper.

Through this unique methodology, students are guided to explore their initial story ideas more deeply, eventually finding and come to understand the kernel of truth at the center of their story. \n\nThe diverse group of students range in age from 11 to 17, and many alumni have gone on in pursuit of filmmaking studies at NYU, Emerson College, Brown and Princeton Universities. Sessions are open to beginners interested in learning the basics to more advanced students exploring their passions for the craft."

    "Space Voyage is best described as a simulation in which groups of students are immersed in the career cross-over skills involved in being an astronaut. The students are invited to think and work \"as if\" they are astronauts, focusing on positive thinking, problem solving, communication, teamwork and pilot skills. A physical environment is created using wall murals, posters, computer work stations and hands-on investigations and experiments. A positive emotional environment is established and enhanced by the Space Voyage program leaders, creating the correct physical and emotional milieu for optimum learning and growth. In this setting, the program invites exploration and encourages proficiency, explains standards of achievement and expected norms of behavior, empowers individual and group achievement, and stresses the importance of group cohesion and tolerance for others. Staff ratio is 1:6.  The program is designed for ongoing studies; many students return from one summer to the next. Described by returning students as one-part Santa's house and one-part Disney World, without the waits.  For most kids, it's the most wonderful week of the summer. FUN!"

Our double-occupancy accommodations will be at the Marriott Renaissance Hotel Boulder Flatirons just outside of Boulder. All our golf will be at Colorado National Golf Club and the George B. Boedecker, Jr. CU Golf Practice Facility.  Colorado National is the home of the University of Colorado golf teams. Colorado National is one of the best golf facilities in the Denver/Boulder metropolitan area. The overnight option is strongly encouraged due to the concentrated schedule of the camp.

Gymnastics is a strenuous sport, and can be difficult when kids are physically very tired.  We want kids to have a fun and safe experience, so we limit our gymnastics time to the equivalent of 2 classes per day.  Don’t worry, we will keep the kids active the rest of the day with games, relays, obstacle courses, and other fun activities!\n\nWhat should kids wear?  Campers should wear comfortable, athletic clothing (no jeans or buttons please!) and dress in layers, as they may get hot or cold during different activities.·\n\nWhat about lunch?  Lunch will be around noon, with snacks given mid-morning and mid-afternoon.· We will provide the snacks, but parents are responsible for sending campers their own BAG LUNCH.· Please remember to let us know if your child has any food allergies as we are providing snacks!\n\nVisit our website for more information!"

    "The Earth Knack Gathering is an opportunity for the whole family to spend five fun-filled days learning to reconnect to the Earth in a practical and moving way. Our top-notch instructors will offer courses in skills that all our ancestors had a knack for. This once-common knowledge, aeons old, is quickly becoming lost as we trade \"up\" in technology. As we become more specialized, we lose sight of the simple pleasures of picking a fresh salad near a mountain stream, making a stone into a sharp tool, weaving a basket to carry our things, or creating beautiful clothing. And as we lose this knowledge, we become dependent, we lose our options, and a part of us dies. We feel this knowledge contains the marrow of life: the spark, the knack for living in harmony with ourselves and the Earth.\n\nAt the Earth Knack Gathering, you will learn the science–the step-by-step process–that enables you to gather and make everything you need from your surroundings. You'll meet kindred spirits as you gain fun and useful skills that you can incorporate into your modern lifestyle. Together we will learn the skills of bow-and-arrow, atlatl, blacksmithing, basketry, pottery, fire-making, outdoor cooking, plant-fiber cordage, wild edibles, medicinal plants, beekeeping, natural gardening, soap-making, natural building, livestock, flintknapping, hide tanning, and much more!\n\nStop simply watching and hearing about it...Get out here and really try it!\nCLASSES IN:\nBLACKSMITHING, WEAVING, POTTERY, FIRE MAKING, BOW AND ARROW, ATLATL, OUTDOOR COOKING, WILD EDIBLES, MEDICINAL PLANTS, CORDAGE, BEE KEEPING, GARDENING, SOAP MAKING, NATURAL BUILDING, LIVE STOCK, BASKETRY, FLINTKNAPPING, HIDE TANNING,\n﻿AND MUCH MORE...."
